# Getting Started

This section walks you through installing, configuring, and running your own Vox server.

## Overview

Vox is designed to be straightforward to deploy. A single Vox server represents one community, and federation allows servers to communicate with each other when enabled.

**What you will need:**

- Python 3.11 or later
- A Rust toolchain (for building the vox-sfu media component)
- A few minutes to configure and start the server
